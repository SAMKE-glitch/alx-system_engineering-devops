What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

For those who want to know more and learn about all signals, check out this article.(https://www.computerhope.com/unix/signals.htm)

0. Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy

2. Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here(https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Ignore))

3. Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

You cannot use ps

4. Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

5. We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You must use kill
Terminal #0
I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 5-dont_stop_me_now. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

6. Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

You cannot use kill or killall
Terminal #0 
I opened 2 terminals in this example, started by running my 4-to_infinity_and_beyond Bash script in terminal #0 and then moved on terminal #1 to run 6-stop_me_if_you_can. We can then see in terminal #0 that my process has been terminated.

7. Write a Bash script that displays:

To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

Terminal #0
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 67-stop_me_if_you_can in terminal #1, for every iteration we can see I am invincible!!! appearing in terminal #0.

8. Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

Terminal #0
I started 7-highlander in Terminal #0 and then run 8-beheaded_process in terminal #1 and we can see that the 7-highlander has been killed.

9. Write a Bash script that:

Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signa
Executing the 100-process_and_pid_file script and killing it with ctrl+c.

Terminal #0
Terminal #1
Starting 100-process_and_pid_file in the terminal #0 and then killing it in the terminal #1.

10. Read:

&(https://bashitout.com/2013/05/18/Ampersands-on-the-command-line.html)
init.d(https://www.ghacks.net/2009/04/04/get-to-know-linux-the-etcinitd-directory/)
Daemon(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29)
Positional parameters(https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Positional-Parameters.html)
man: sudo
Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.

Write a manage_my_process Bash script that:

Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds
Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. (both files need to be pushed to git)

Requirements:

When passing the argument start:
Starts manage_my_process
Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid
Displays manage_my_process started
When passing the argument stop:
Stops manage_my_process
Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid
Displays manage_my_process stopped
When passing the argument restart
Stops manage_my_process
Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid
Starts manage_my_process
Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid
Displays manage_my_process restarted
Displays Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart} if any other argument or no argument is passed
Note that this init script is far from being perfect (but good enough for the sake of manipulating process and PID file), for example we do not handle the case where we check if a process is already running when doing ./101-manage_my_process start, in our case it will simply create a new process instead of saying that it is already started.

11. Read what a zombie process is.(https://zombieprocess.wordpress.com/what-is-a-zombie-process/)
Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.

Requirements:

For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
When your code is done creating the parent process and the zombies, use the function bellow

Example:

Terminal #0

Terminal #1
In Terminal #0, I start by compiling 102-zombie.c and executing zombie which creates 5 zombie processes. In Terminal #1, I display the list of processes and look for lines containing Z+.*<defunct> which catches zombie process.
